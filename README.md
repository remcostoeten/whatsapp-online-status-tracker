This tool starts up a Chrome (driver) instance and goes to WhatsApp Web. You don't want to authenticate every time, and since each chromedriver reboot resets the browser, you need to create a Chrome profile. Do so by running `google-chrome --user-data-dir=/path/to/your/new/profile` in the root of the project. Navigate to WhatsApp, authenticate, and optionally install extensions like WhatsApp Plus to hide blue checkmarks.

## Requirements

> Download chromedriver from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

> Have Python 3 installed.

## Run Locally

btw,runs fine on my machine. Linux, PopOS.

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remcostoeten/whatsapp-online-status-tracker.git
cd whatsapp-online-status-tracker
```

2. Create a new Chrome profile:

```bash
google-chrome --user-data-dir=~/chrome-profile                                                                                                                                                                                                          ```

Navigate to WhatsApp Web in the new Chrome instance, authenticate, and optionally install extensions like WhatsApp Plus to hide blue checkmarks.

3. Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
python app.py
### or python3 app.py. Have struggled with that in the past if you're new. ðŸ™ƒ
```

Now, you can navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to use the application.

### Roadmap

I have a React/NextJS API route working which I might make available someday. Also displaying data, e.g. logging, doesn't do anything on the front-end. Logs are filled in JSON format so you can API yourself in the root.
