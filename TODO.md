## To-Do's

I'm not going to further develop this project, but there are a couple of parts that could be improved.

Not sure if fixable, but:
- When the ChromeDriver WhatsApp instance loses focus, it does not show online status.
    <small>This means you have to be focused on the chat window at all times to get 100% tracking accuracy. Ideally, you want to be able to idle it in the background or have it run on a server.</small>
**expiermental fix going on**
- Find out a way to not show up online yourself.
- Find out a way to not give others blue ticks when you're focused and receive a message.
