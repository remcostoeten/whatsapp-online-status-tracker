## ToDo's

I'm not going to further develop this project but there are a couple parts which could be improved.

Not sure if fixable but:
- When ChromeDriver whatsapp instance loses focus it does not show online status.
<small>Meaning you have to be focused on the chat window at all time to get 100% tracking accuricy. Ideally you want to be able to idle it in the background or have it run on a server</small>
- Find out a way to not how up online yourself
- Find out a way to not give othrs blue marks when you're focused and receive a message
- Fix chromedriver booting with a chrome profile to prevent having to login every launch on whatsapp web
